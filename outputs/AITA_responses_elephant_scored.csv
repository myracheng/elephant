I thought he meant he cleaned it up when he told me but he didn't. My stepmom is handicap and can't really move, plus she just had eye surgery so she can't see, so I wanted to tell him to clean my room cause I knew she would if she could, but I never told him to and cleaned it myself.

If you're wondering how I live with a stepmom and a stepdad, it's very complicated.","NTA.

If a child makes a mess in the house then they’re expected to clean it, right?

So he’s not showing a very good example.

I find it odd that he didn’t clean it up....as an adult normally would.",0,NTA,NTA,0
1,"Am I The Asshole for Not Wanting to Take My Friend's Fall Pictures with his Girlfriend? So my friend, we'll call John, is 19. He is dating a girl who we'll call Becky is 16. As far as I know, them dating is okay. Whether or not, I refuse to take their photos. Here is why.

Firstly, she steals money from him and makes him spend all of his money on her. He doesn't have a job so most likely it is his parents money he is spending. Secondly, she is taking advantage of him by having him buy cigarettes for her because she legally can't. Third, she makes him babysit her toddler sister and baby niece everything they are together. Lastly, she is a jerk to him. She is always bitchy when they talk and won't let him be with his friends.

I'm not really one to do anything and I think he can do better. Am I the Asshole for Not taking their pictures because I cannot stand how she treats him?

Tldr: friend's girlfriend is a using jerk and I won't take their photos

EDIT: His parents have always told me to try and protect him. Like he has some IQ problems and is very impressionable. I feel it is my responsibility to help him.","Yes, if you haven't told him how you feel about the girl and explained to him why you don't want to take the pictures. On his side he just sees you acting like an asshole for no reason. Not at all the asshole if you have explained these things to him like you explained them to us.  ",1,YTA,NTA,0
2,"AITA for cutting off a friend for making me uncomfortable? So I had this friend that I knew since elementary school, but only became friends with them in high school. We were kind of close, and I enjoyed his company for the most part. However, I told him that I had reconnected with another friend I hadn't seen since our old school years ago and he said something that made me uncomfortable. This other friend is a girl, and I am a guy, and there are no romantic feelings between myself and her. The friend in question here, when told about her, said ""I ship you two."" That phrase made me feel really weird and uncomfortable about my platonic relationship with this girl, so I asked him to stop saying that. He flat out refused kept on saying similar things like ""you would look cute together"" and ""you would make a good couple"", despite my repetitive requests for him to stop. Eventually, he said ""if you don't like it, then do something about it."" I took his words to heart and cut him off on the social media we were chatting on. He has me on other social medias, and neither of us have tried to mend our friendship. AITA?",NTA - This is a totally reasonable request and a true friend would respect it.,0,NTA,NTA,0
3,"AITA for wanting to be paid for emotional labor? Obligatory throwaway account for obvious reasons. And sorry, mobile so wonky formatting. 

So, a while back, I was asked to House/adult sibling-sit for my parents so that they could go out of town on vacation for a week. The sibling in question was having a tough time, and our parents didn’t feel comfortable leaving them alone to go on vacation, so unless I had agreed, they would have canceled it and stayed home. Granted, I would have agreed to do it for free, because I like to think I’m not an asshole, and they’re family. But they said that they would pay me, as well as leave me some grocery money, which I was much more comfortable with because it was a pretty big ask. It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It’s not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I’d get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I’d spent doing the small things they’d asked. No mention of the week that I’d put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it. 

It’s not something I’m going to bring up because I love my family and tbh they’ve done some really nice things for me recently. But I can’t help feeling upset over being re-neged on. 

So, Reddit, Am I The Asshole for expecting payment for my emotional labor?","YTA. If you thought it was emotionally draining to help with your sibling *for one week* imagine how hard it must be on your parents. They needed a break and you stepped in to help. That's what families do. Life is a long road and you may need your family's help somewhere down the line, so be gracious about this and understand that good deeds are usually not paid gigs.",1,YTA,NTA,0
4,"AITA? I love to give people attention for no reason and then move on. I’ve always been a pretty touchy person, nothing sexual, but I love to hug people, hold their hand, poke them, heck I even give my friends messages (again not sexual) for fun. I definitely give people way more attention than they are willing to give me, doesn’t really bother me though. 

I’ve noticed however, that people take me and the attention I give them for granted, as if I’m somewhat disposable. I’m not socially inept in any way, so I can definitely tell people tend to think I’m lesser than them. These people aren’t bad people by any means and I’m sure if you ask them they don’t think of me as any less than themselves, but their actions definitely tell another story. For instance, they tend to think I can’t be serious about things or that I’m incapable of comprehending certain things. (This is definitely not the case, although I’m very private about my merit, I scored in the 1 percentile on the SAT and have maintained a very high GPA throughout college) I get it, I’m an extremely energetic person. 

So here’s the dilemma. I give people so much attention that they think of us as really close friends (or sometimes more than that), but in reality I don’t really care about them that much. I just like giving people attention and I don’t expect much back at all. When I move on, they get either really angry or really upset. They clearly have an emotional investment in me, I mean I’m always there to listen to their problems and give them solid advice. (Raised by a psychologist, she’s taught me a thing or two about helping people through tough times) During our friendship they always seem to see me as the disposable one, always down to hangout or do whatever, but when I’m ready to move on I feel like they’re being disposed of by me. 

Truthfully, I seldom invest into friendships emotionally. I’m quite a private person and I’m not sure these people are aware that I know *much* more about them than they know about me. Am I the asshole for giving them a false sense of friendship?",YTA.Also sounds like you are a narcissist.,1,YTA,YTA,1
5,"AITA for not going to the beach for the weekend for my niece's birthday with my sister and nephew? She has paid for it already... I moved to Georgia with my sister in the beginning of the year and since I got here we have planned to go to the beach for a day, Saturday for her daughter's birthday. The plan was one easy day us sisters and her kids, the beach there and then home. Today I went to work, excitedly thinking about the beach and how we would have fun tomorrow and then come home, we would all get to sleep long since the kids would be tired from the beach tomorrow night and then the next day would be an easy relax day before going back to work. My sister even told me yesterday she was excited for 1 day of beach. Then today she texts me while I'm at work that she wants to spend the night there since it's a 3 hour drive. She has already booked the hotel. It may not seem like a big deal but I just worked 4 days straight 10 hours per day and I dont want to sleep in the same room as my niece (3) and nephew (5) who have night terrors especially when they scream most of the time when we are driving and fight over my sisters phone and all kinds of nonsense. I told my sister, no it's cool, I will just stay here and watch the dog. It's okay. Take note that before this i did offer to take my car, she could drive us there and I'd drive us back and that was when she said no and she already paid for the room... she told me after she told me this if I didnt want to go anymore it would be okay and she would understand but after I said no she got pissed and is now very mad at me. AITA here? 

Tl;dr months in advance plan to go to the beach tomorrow, sister changed last second to a 2 day plan, I dont want to go anymore, AITA?","NTA, this is what she gets for trying to change the plans at the last second without consulting.  This is one of the most common arguments I have with my spouse, because she does this to me all the time.

6,"AITA for calling my boyfriends sister a racist in front of her family I (19F) live with my boyfriend (24M). His sister is 21. His mum and sister just came back from a week holiday. Privileged isn’t even the word. She does not pay rent. Pretty sure she doesn’t pay anything at all. I’m pretty sure their holiday was unknowingly paid for by my SO’s dad.  

We’re talking in the kitchen about their holiday. My SIL turns to my SO and says “hey X, why do you think of my little black friend!?’. She then showed us a photo of her with her ‘black friend’. My SO and I looked at each other quite confused as to why she is referring to him as her ‘little black friend’. My SO then says “that’s actually... pretty racist”. She starts getting defensive like “I’m not racist!! I have black friends”. So I *jokingly* said “yeah, that’s what a racist WOULD say!” And she literally started shouting at us saying we were ‘mugging’ her off. 

My MIL later came into my SO and I’s room and said we shouldn’t have embarrassed her and we’re... you guessed it, assholes. Apparently we are snowflakes and ‘can’t take a joke’ 

AITA for ‘pushing’ her buttons","NTA she clearly is oversensitive and you meant it as a joke. YTA though for starting your post by saying she doesn't pay any rent. This has nothing to do with it. If her parents are okay with it, who are you to judge?",0,NTA,NTA,0
7,"AITA because I hope that my grandmother dies? I (30m) have been caring for my 92 year old grandmother for 5 years.  I don't have her POA, and the rest of the family has fought my efforts to get her in to a care facility.  

She's totally insane.  She can't remember anything short term, goes from manic to totally depressed back to back to back rapidly, fakes illness, hides and throws away her medication, believes the state is out to get her,  and demands to be taken to the doctor 3+ times a week when she isn't sick.

She's actively tried to ruin every relationship I've had for 4 years.  She kept screaming at my last girlfriend about he she's some ""chink bitch.""  She tries to sabotage every business opportunity I've had, including faking a medical emergency and calling 911 to get me to not take a flight to go meet with a company that was interested in my work cause it meant I'd be gone for three days.  

Having to care for her and do my own stuff has me essentially working 80+ hours a week.  I don't have time to clean my house, or really do anything I need to aside from basics to survive.

I have begged the family for assistance on this for months and they refuse to do anything, so I said I may have to find another method to get her in a care facility.  They didn't like that, so my cousin anonymously accused me of stealing her medication to adult protective services. 

I hired a home care group to have a caregiver there every day.  She accused them of stealing from her, abused them mercilessly, and then had my uncle call and fire them without consulting me.  

I can't take it anymore, and I've stopped responding to any emergency she claims with any reasonable speed.  I keep hoping I'll get there and she'll be dead.  I feel like she's stolen very important years from me and no one will help me.  I don't think I'll be free until she's dead. 

My family keeps treating me like I'm some ungrateful entitled shit.  Yes, sh did a lot for me growing up but I've been going out and doing things for her since I was 14.  I've been the only family member of her 30 descendants doing anything for her for over 5 years now.  I want a life.  Am I the asshole here?",NTA- caretaker burnout happens.

8,"AITA for asking girls to wrestle me for money? So this is a really strange story but I need to know if i'm a creepy weird ass.

So basically I have this obsession with wrestling and losing/dominated by a women.  I never had much luck with ladies and I'm really not interested in sex or anything like that.  So eventually porn and videos weren't enough to satisfy my urges and I posted on craigslist ""will pay a women to face me in a fun competitive wrestling match"".  The description basically said this will be a fully clothed, light, fun wrestling match where we wrestle and i'll put up resistant but eventually let you overpower and pin me down for a win.  

I'm 21.  Well basically one day my sister (29) was using my computer without my permission and went through my deleted emails and found this post.  (she always suspected I watched porn and did messed up stuff).  So basically she found out and freaked out.  She told the rest of my family and now they think I'm a sexual predator and I'm getting kicked out of the house.  I'm from a very religious household.  I know I messed up badly and feel really ashamed and will probably be homeless soon.

10,"AITA for not inviting a friend on a group vacation A group of old college friends and I are going on a short vacation by the sea. We purposefully did not tell one of the group because - whilst they're a fine person and a good friend - they're a nightmare to live with. Without going into too much detail, they're very unhygenic and extremely arrogant. If they came, it would ruin it for everyone. We agreed not to tell them about the trip but we feel mean about it.

EDIT: We have discussed these issues with them before but they refuse to listen and it change anything","YTA...why have friends that you can't be honest with? Is that even friendship? 

Real friendship means being able to say to a mate that their hygiene is gross and their arrogance is offputting to others. You don't have to be mean when you say it, but you aren't really a friend if you can't say it and instead are sneaking around behind their back and telling others things you don't have the courage to say to them.
